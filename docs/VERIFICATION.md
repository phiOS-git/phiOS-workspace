## Shrink the launcher to fit its results, top edge held fixed

- **Date:** 2026-09-11
- **Repo / branch:** phi-shell / dev
- **Commits:** c778f51 launcher: shrink to fit the result count, top edge held fixed
- **Original TODO:** the runner should resize it's height when there are not enough options to fill it. (Anchored on the top)

### What was asked
The launcher box always opens at its full ~20-row height, even for a query
with only one or two matches — a tall mostly-empty box below a short
result list. It should shrink to fit however many results there actually
are, and do so without the box's top edge (where the search field sits)
moving — only the bottom edge should move as the height changes.

### What was done
This reverses a deliberate earlier decision (OOP-12, in the historical
log): the box used to be a fixed height specifically "so the box opens at
full height and never grows/shrinks as results change." The TODO entry is
the newer instruction on the same question, so `Launcher/Launcher.qml`'s
comments were updated to say so explicitly, not just changed silently.

The result list (`resultFlick`) now sizes to
`root.currentListBoxHeight`, which is `resultList.implicitHeight` (however
many rows are actually showing, or the "no results" label's height, or 0
when nothing is shown) capped at the unchanged `maxListBoxHeight` — the
same ~20-row / 62%-of-screen limit as before, so a full or near-full
result set renders exactly as it did previously.

The harder part was the "top edge held fixed" half. The box
(`panelWrap`) is centred on screen via `anchors.verticalCenter`; before
this change its height was bound to the visible panel's own height, so a
shorter panel would re-centre and its top edge would drift downward.
Fixed by decoupling the two: `panelWrap`'s height is now pinned to
`root.maxPanelHeight` (the box's full height at maximum size, used only
for this positioning calculation — panelWrap itself draws nothing), while
the visible `panel` still sizes to its own, possibly smaller, actual
content and sits explicitly at `panelWrap`'s top edge
(`anchors.top: parent.top`, made explicit — it previously relied on the
Item default of (0, 0), which was harmless before because panelWrap and
panel were always the same height). Two other places that assumed
panelWrap's bounds matched the visible panel's needed the same fix:
`panelWrap`'s own click-swallowing `MouseArea` (now sized to `panel.height`
instead of filling all of the now-taller `panelWrap`, so a click just
below a shrunk box still falls through to close the launcher, as a click
outside it should) and the rich-result card's narrow-screen anchor (now a
`panelWrap.top` anchor with `panel.height` folded into the top margin,
since `richWrap` is a sibling of `panelWrap`, not of `panel`, and QML only
allows anchoring to a parent or a sibling — an actual bug hit and fixed
during review, not a hypothetical).

Checked one interaction before treating this as safe: `setShown(false)`
(the launcher's close path) already clears `queryText` alongside
`results`, so reopening the launcher always starts in browse mode (every
installed app, alphabetically — a long list) rather than a leftover
empty-results state that this change could otherwise have turned into a
visible "sliver" on reopen. No change was needed there.

### Honest assessment
- **Not visually verified** — phi-shell's own rule: "you cannot run this,"
  every visual result needs the user's own screenshot. This is layout/
  anchoring logic, reviewed by tracing the QML by hand (including
  confirming `Widgets/Panel.qml` really is a plain, non-self-anchoring
  `Item`, and that the rich-card anchor change above is legal QML — an
  earlier draft of this fix anchored `richWrap` directly to `panel.bottom`,
  which is illegal since they aren't parent/sibling; caught before
  committing, not left as a shipped bug), not by running it.
- Specifically worth checking on hardware: (1) with a short result list,
  does the box's search field visibly stay in the same screen position as
  it does with a long one, only the bottom edge moving; (2) with a short
  result list on a narrow screen, does the rich-result card (when a
  calculator/plot result is highlighted) sit right below the shrunk box,
  not floating with a gap where the old full-height box used to end; (3)
  clicking just below a shrunk box should close the launcher, not swallow
  the click.
- `PROGRESS.md` was not updated — §5's Launcher row is architectural
  ("Launcher — a renderer only...") and doesn't change with this fix; this
  is the fourth commit in this session's run that didn't touch it, noted
  here explicitly rather than left silent.

### How to test it
1. Build `phi-shell` from this branch and reload Quickshell (`pkill -x qs;
   qs -p ~/.config/quickshell/phi`), or save any `.qml` file to trigger
   its hot reload.
2. Open the launcher (`Super` or whatever it's bound to) with nothing
   typed — confirm it looks exactly as before: full height, browsing every
   installed app.
3. Type a query that matches only one or two things (a specific app name,
   or an arithmetic expression like `2+2`). Confirm the box is now short —
   just tall enough for those few rows — rather than a tall box with empty
   space below the results.
4. While that short box is showing, note where its top edge (the search
   field) sits on screen. Clear the query back to nothing (full list) and
   back to the short query again — confirm the top edge is in the same
   place both times; only the bottom edge should have moved.
5. On a narrow window/screen, highlight a calculator result (e.g. type
   `2+2`) so the rich-result card appears — confirm it sits directly below
   the (now short) box, not with a gap.
6. Click in the empty space just below a shrunk box (where the box used to
   extend to before this fix) — confirm the launcher closes, the same as
   clicking anywhere else outside it.

## Reset the clipboard tab every time the panel opens

- **Date:** 2026-09-11
- **Repo / branch:** phi-shell / dev
- **Commits:** ccf5477 clipboard: reset selection, filter and scroll every time the panel opens
- **Original TODO:** clipboard should reset the current selection every time it's opened, starting back from the top.

### What was asked
Every time the notification panel is opened on the Clipboard tab, it
should start from a clean state: no leftover search filter, the first
entry selected, scrolled to the top — not whatever was left over from the
last time it was open.

### What was done
Found the cause in `Panels/Sidebar.qml`: the tab content is a `Loader`
whose `sourceComponent` only changes when the active tab index changes —
opening and closing the whole panel just toggles `PanelWindow.visible`
upstream, it does not touch the Loader, so the Clipboard tab's `Item` is
never destroyed by a plain show/hide. That means `Component.onCompleted`
(where the reset already happened) only ever ran the very first time the
Clipboard tab was opened in a session; every later reopen — panel closed,
then reopened while still parked on that tab — kept the old search text,
selection and scroll offset.

`Panels/tabs/Clipboard.qml`: moved the existing reset logic into a
`reset()` function, called from `Component.onCompleted` as before, and
now also from a `Connections { target: Services.NotificationPanel;
function onShownChanged() { ... } }` block that fires on the `shown`
transition to `true` — the same `Connections`/`onXChanged` shape already
used the same way in `Settings.qml`, `Spotlight.qml` and `Launcher.qml`,
so nothing new was introduced stylistically. Also added `list.contentY =
0` to the reset (`list` is the id given to the entry `Flickable`, which
previously had no id) — nothing previously reset the scroll position, only
`highlightedIndex`, so "starting back from the top" was only half true
even within a single session.

### Honest assessment
- **Cannot verify visually** — phi-shell's own rule: "you cannot run
  this," every visual result needs the user's own screenshot. This is a
  logic fix (state reset on a property-changed signal), not a visual one,
  so it was reviewed by reading the surrounding code and cross-checking
  the `Connections` pattern against four other files that already use it
  the same way, not by running it.
- One behaviour to be aware of, not a bug: opening the panel straight onto
  the Clipboard tab (`Super+Shift+V`, which sets the tab index *and*
  `shown` together) can run `reset()` twice in a row (once from
  `Component.onCompleted` as the Loader creates the item, once from the
  `Connections` handler as `shown` becomes true right after) — harmless
  since `reset()` is idempotent, just a redundant `Services.Clipboard.refresh()`
  call, not a state problem.
- Switching tabs away from Clipboard and back while the panel stays open
  already reset correctly before this change (a tab switch gives the
  Loader a new `sourceComponent`, so a fresh `Item` is created either
  way) — untouched by this fix, still works the same way.

### How to test it
1. Build `phi-shell` from this branch and reload Quickshell (`pkill -x qs;
   qs -p ~/.config/quickshell/phi`), or just save any `.qml` file to
   trigger its hot reload.
2. Copy two or three different things to the clipboard so there's more
   than one entry.
3. Open the panel onto the Clipboard tab (`Super+Shift+V`), type a few
   characters into the filter box, and press Down/Tab a couple of times so
   a later entry (not the first) is highlighted.
4. Close the panel (click outside it, or `Super+N`) without selecting
   anything.
5. Reopen it onto the Clipboard tab again (`Super+Shift+V`). Before this
   fix: the filter text and the previously-highlighted entry were still
   there. After this fix: the filter box is empty, the first entry
   (topmost, pinned entries first) is highlighted, and if the list had
   been scrolled, it is back at the top.

## Recognise phi verbs in the launcher without the "phi " prefix

- **Date:** 2026-09-11
- **Repo / branch:** phi / dev
- **Commits:** 3e7d49a query: recognise phi's own verbs without the leading "phi "
- **Original TODO:** runner bar should read phi commands without writing the phi prefix (eg. "theme set dark" is recognised as "phi theme set dark")

### What was asked
Typing a `phi` verb straight into the launcher, e.g. `theme set dark`,
should be recognised as if `phi ` had been typed first, and offered as a
result that runs `phi theme set dark`.

### What was done
Added `PhiCommandProvider` (`internal/query/phicommand.go`): it fires when
the query's first word matches one of phi's own verb names, and offers a
result whose action runs `phi <the whole query>` in a terminal — the same
`ActionExecTerminal` action `CommandProvider` already uses for "phi theme
set dark" typed in full (so it fires because `phi` itself resolves as a
PATH binary), so output stays visible either way.

The verb list comes from `view.Commands` — the single list `phi help`,
zsh completion and the man page already render from — so a verb added
there needs nothing else touched. It's passed in by `internal/cli` rather
than imported straight into `internal/query.Providers`, because
`internal/view` already imports `internal/query` (to render
`QueryResults`); the reverse import would be a cycle. `Providers()` picked
up a second parameter for this (`phiVerbs map[string]bool`); it has
exactly one call site (`internal/cli/query.go`), now updated.

Placed in the same `tierAction` band as `CommandProvider`, `system`, `ssh`
and `directory` (from the ranking fix earlier in this same session — see
the entry above).

### Honest assessment
- **Verb match is on the first word only**, case-insensitive, with no
  minimum query length — typing just `doctor` recognises `phi doctor`
  exactly as `theme set dark` recognises `phi theme set dark`. But for a
  *bare single-word* verb with no other candidate competing (an app, a
  file, a window), a **pre-existing, unrelated quirk in the calculator
  engine** (`internal/mathx`) often wins instead: it treats any single
  unrecognised word as a one-variable expression and offers to *plot* it
  (`evalNumeric` in `internal/mathx/engine.go` — "if there is exactly one
  free variable... the useful answer is a plot of it"). E.g. `phi query
  doctor` today ranks `y = doctor` (a spurious plot) above `phi doctor`,
  because that path sits in this session's own math tier, above the
  action tier `phi doctor` sits in. Multi-word verb invocations like
  `theme set dark` are unaffected — the calculator's parser doesn't treat
  three bare words as one plottable expression, so it produces nothing
  there. Left alone rather than fixed here: it's a mathx behaviour with
  its own separate cause, not something this TODO entry named, and
  narrowing what mathx treats as "one free variable worth plotting" is a
  bigger, riskier change than this entry asked for. Worth its own backlog
  entry if it bothers you in practice.
- Not run against `phi-shell`'s actual launcher UI (no compositor here) —
  verified with `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...`, and
  manual `phi query "<text>"` runs from a terminal.

### How to test it
1. From a terminal, on a machine with this branch: `phi query "theme set
   dark"` (or, with the shell running, type the same into the launcher).
   Confirm a result titled `phi theme set dark` appears, and selecting it
   opens a terminal running `phi theme set dark`.
2. Try a few more: `phi query "vpn status"`, `phi query "firewall status"`
   — each should offer to run the equivalent full `phi …` command.
3. Try a bare single-word verb, e.g. `phi query "doctor"` — see the
   Honest Assessment above: today this may rank a spurious calculator
   plot above the `phi doctor` result rather than putting it first.
4. Try a word that is not a phi verb, e.g. `phi query "firefox"` — no `phi
   …` result should appear at all.

## Rank launcher results by category before match quality

- **Date:** 2026-09-11
- **Repo / branch:** phi / dev
- **Commits:** 6b5f4c9 query: rank by category tier before match quality
- **Original TODO:** ranking for the runner should be rearranged in a reasonable way. Currently it has latest features appearing first (like the calculator) but it does not make sense. Apps should be always first, non hidden files second, math when obvious,

### What was asked
The launcher's result ranking felt wrong — the calculator was showing up
above things like applications, which doesn't match how the launcher is
actually used. The requested order: applications first, always; non-hidden
files second; math results third, and only when the query is unambiguously
math.

### What was done
`phi query`'s ranking (`internal/query/rank.go`) previously scored every
provider on one shared 0–100-ish scale. `CalculatorProvider` and
`CurrencyProvider` trust their own confidence and set a flat `Score: 100`
(matchWeight can't judge a numeric answer like "4" against the query "2+2"
that produced it), which routinely tied or beat a genuine exact-title app
match — that's the reported bug.

Added a `providerTier` band per provider category, spaced 1000 apart (well
clear of the largest possible per-query contribution: 100 from matchWeight
+ 15 from frecency), added on top of whatever score a provider already
computed. Category now always dominates; match quality and frecency only
decide order *within* a category. Order, highest first: applications, open
windows, files, math (calculator + currency), then the narrower/deliberate
providers (system actions, ssh hosts, zoxide, run-command), then web
search last.

Two things not explicitly named in the TODO entry, decided by judgment:
- **Windows sit just under apps**, not with files. `query.go`'s own header
  already calls switching to an open window "likely the most frequent
  launcher action on a tiling compositor" — closer in kind to launching
  than to a file search.
- Everything else the TODO entry didn't name (system actions, ssh hosts,
  zoxide, run-command, web search) kept its previous *relative* order
  (already established by each provider's own flat Score), just moved
  below math as a block, since each is a narrower, more deliberate action.

"math when obvious" is read as already true today: `CalculatorProvider` /
`CurrencyProvider` only produce a result once `mathx` actually parses the
query as math or a currency conversion — this change only affects where
that result ranks once it exists, not whether it appears. "Non hidden"
files come from `fd`'s own default (it excludes dotfiles/gitignored paths
unless told otherwise) — no explicit flag was added.

### Honest assessment
- **Consequence worth flagging:** typing the exact name of an app that is
  already open now always ranks "launch a new instance" above "switch to
  that open window", because `tierApps` unconditionally beats
  `tierWindows`. That follows literally from "Apps should be always
  first," but it may not be what's wanted day-to-day — easy to swap
  (`tierApps`/`tierWindows` are two lines in `rank.go`) if so.
- The tier boundaries for the categories the TODO entry didn't name
  (system/ssh/zoxide/command all share one "action" tier, below math) are
  a judgment call, not something requested — flag if any of those feel
  wrong once used for real.
- Not run against real launcher usage or `fzf` (`rank_test.go`'s own
  header already notes this limitation predates this change) — verified
  with `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, and manual `phi query` runs from a
  terminal, not on real hardware with the shell attached.
- Confirmed `phi-shell`'s `Launcher.qml` never reads `Result.Score` (it
  only renders the list `phi query` already returned in order), so scores
  moving from ~0–100 to ~0–5115 is safe — it's an internal ranking value,
  not part of the JSON contract the shell interprets.

### How to test it
1. On a machine with `phi` built from this branch (or after the next
   package build once this reaches `main`), open the launcher and type an
   application name that also happens to look like it could match another
   category — e.g. a query that both an app title and a calculator
   expression could answer.
2. Confirm the application result appears above any calculator/currency
   result, regardless of how exact the app-title match is.
3. Type a partial file name (something under `$HOME`, at least 2
   characters) that also loosely matches an installed application's title
   — confirm the application still ranks above the file, and the file
   ranks above any calculator result.
4. Type a plain arithmetic expression, e.g. `2+2` — confirm it still
   appears (math results are unaffected when nothing else matches).
5. From a terminal, `phi query "<your query>" | jq .` also works without
   the shell — each result's `score` field shows the new tier bands
   (5000s = apps, 4000s = windows, 3000s = files, 2000s = math, 1000s =
   the rest, 0s = web search) if you want to see the ordering directly.
